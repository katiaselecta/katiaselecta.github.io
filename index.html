					<h3>Thoughts from a Recent Summer</h3>
					<p>
						The grips of certain substances past have loosened their hold on me. My arms no longer bound to the paraphernalia that pulls me back into that familiar and frequent slumber. I’m alert and capable; maintaining the new life that I’ve cultivated for myself here. I’ve found a harmonious balance. Self and other. Internal and external. Active and passive.
					</p>	

					<p>
						I long to rest upon the shore of an open lake, feet submerged in the cool swells of Baltic water. A place to nurture my love. A place to explore and be explored, to practice peacefulness and expression. Soon. 
					</p>	

					<p>
						My friendships feel watered and somewhat renewed. I’m letting go of any hindersome first impressions and allowing myself to indulge in many personalities; all they have to offer me, and I them. 
					</p>	

					<p>
						It’s summertime again, the air is balmy and warm, soothing yet also mildly aggravating. The library smells of hot dust. The stillness of my company fails to disturb me during my hours spent here. I’m wilfully unemployed; recommitted to my academic path. I see the outcome clearly now, within my grasp. And the path is chosen by me, tailored by me, for me. Almost artistic; finetuned to the self. A satisfaction unfamiliar or perhaps forgotten. Oh to unravel the self, to become the person once intended and now intended again for me to become.
					</p>	

					<p>
						I’ve found that place and it shall grow with me. It shall not trap me or fool me again.
					</p>

					<h3>Thoughts from a Recent Winter</h3>
					<p>
						I feel imprisoned by London, not committed to love but to this academic undertaking of mine. I rest in a state of disillusionment; its meaning escapes me.
				    </p>

					<p>
						How much to share is a resounding question. Where is the border between boring and initially untrusting? The things I feel to share and speak of are often the hardest to say. And to whom? To whom do I give myself away to? And in what fashion? Surely not hastily, but confidently and trustingly. What will I benefit from sharing; darkness or light? Or perhaps both.
					</p>

					<p>	
						This leads me to realise that there must be some benefit from balance. In all aspects and areas of life no less. At home I become tempted by substances. Increasingly so now that it’s bitter cold outside and smoke fills the living area, beside comforts and ruckus and late evenings of wine and indulgence. The cumulative effects have in past – and truly in present too – taken their toll on my mood. And manifest within me deep apathy, lethargy, intolerably familiar and comfortable. Yet draining and toxic, subtly so. 
					</p>

					<p>	
						Where I have been, I know the ways out. Social dimensions obscure my once recognisable surroundings, so I must garner real and great energy to combat mundanity and obstacles. It is true that I am not starting from the beginning. This is recovery. 
					</p>	

					<h3>Thoughts from a Past Summer</h3>
					<p>
						Just write and release and unload. Breakfast never enough to satisfy; my body craves attention, love and peace. My skin and warmth are comfortable, and my hair is smooth. I’m growing like a strand of hair, precariously for I may split or fall. Tied up until let down and trimmed fresh each time.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am free, my body is free, to share. Free and light and meaningful; open to experience, not searching for experience. Patience and they will come. They are coming, I’m moving away in four days, the experience on the horizon waiting for me to reach it, nervously anticipating my presence in the plan unfolding. Like crumpled paper into a sketch, an art-piece, to be framed and saved, adored. Appreciated for what it is and what it may be interpreted to be, to mean. A flower blossoming late, during a spring long after its peers. The other blossoms budded and bloomed and fell apart back into the Earth. To repeat. Insects help to spread this love of life and growth. Spirited leaders of the cycle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Part of my journey, allowing the growth, change and fluctuations that come with seasons. I adjust slowly to the Earth’s changes and the internal changes I experience. But I will grow from the dust like a phoenix, or a sturdy tree with a legacy. Saplings surrounding it as it nourishes itself without thoughts or conscious effort. Habitual it will become to feel free, healthy and full of life. Every day as intended upon this Earth.
					</p>
					<p>
						For centuries others may have been me, suffering at the hand of oneself, struggling to see beauty. Hiding from the light, under dark damp rock, reflecting peace away in attempt to protect oneself from misery; only harbouring more of that fear - misery. But there is hope, there always has been. Peace comes when one feels settled and comforted by all surroundings, regardless of light, mood, company, luxuries. One must find comfort in the small things, the free things bestowed upon this Earth for enjoyment. Enjoy the fruits of this life, or do not experience life at all. Mere survival does not turn into gratitude and acceptance, it kills life and joy and stuffs them away in a box somewhere. They seem alive, though they are not. One must open the box, sow the seeds, water and nurture them until the next spring and they will astound you and present you once again with life for oneself.
					</p>
					<p>
						I cannot feel circulation in my toes, they long to be free of this tortured body. Days like these are tough, a waiting game that I play alone. Watching time, not experiencing it or utilising its fleeting presence. Just allowing it to flow downstream, ever further away, ever harder to grasp. Nothing is seeded in the absence of acceptance of time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Freed by expression, my thoughts are out of me. They belong not to me, they are not me. I shall not starve them of this release any longer. They shall be shared. With paper, pens, people, loves. The Earth deserves to know what it has created within me. As do I, deserve to note what is going on; always to be aware. To be aware is to experience, it is natural yet avoidable, with only detriment to the avoider.
