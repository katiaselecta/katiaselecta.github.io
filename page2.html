					<h3>
						Some Ideas of Late
					</h3>

					<p>
						Changed scenery again, it’s fresh and inviting. I’m secure in the surroundings, quite secluded and quiet; one can think. Things are organised and adjusted for me and I to them. A year ago, I’d have never of thought that I would be here, under these circumstances and with this wonderful company. 
					</p>
					
					<p>	
						I am really growing with this companionship, I think it suits me. I am myself, all of myself, nothing is hidden away anymore, no fear. It’s a pleasant place to be, I suppose I deserve it after so long spent in suboptimal milieus. My inner child, parent and adult are all in harmony, all expressed and all thriving here. I wish to stay here for now and relish in this space. 
					</p>
					
					<p>	
						It seems that there is some strict importance to moving around, not just from area to area but from different states of being. It is true that the environment shapes one, but sometimes it’s all too hard to recognise how this occurs. The effect is more profound, or perhaps just plainly positive, if one chooses the said environment. This is nothing groundbreaking, just an observation of late. 
					</p>
					
					<h3>
						Some Ideas of Old
					</h3>	
			
					<p>
						I like the green of the leaves on the trees outside and their movements in the wind like frills on a dress, flittering. There is blossom, metaphorical I believe of the growth I am to experience. I have many experiences ahead of me, who knows what they are? 
					</p>	

					<p>
						I don’t like that I am typing right now as the keys are distracting me, making me think of black squares and letters and keyboards rather than something natural and unprovoked.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						An overwhelming pit of emptiness in my stomach. Hunger. Or loneliness, emotional emptiness. Hunger causes this, you know it, stop denying it every day. Lead yourself not by emotions but by goals. What I want to achieve is happiness, how can goals help reach this? Is this a goal or a state? I feel greedy, everyone wants to be happy and not everyone is. I feel like most people are depressed and I included for the most part. Starved brain or not, the feelings are identical I would imagine. The causes can vary but the feeling in the present moment is universal. Or maybe not, it is my experience alone that I can interpret, not the history of humanity and whether they were predominantly depressed or happy and fulfilled. I think intelligence kills the prospect of happiness, I must shut off the overthinking and analysing and just be in the moment like I am now. Experiencing myself fully and my environment too.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The image before me when I look up is largely green. Trees, plants, grass and flowers of white and pink dotted in. Thick green, many hues of it, and browns and greys of the clouds. The planet is beautiful from this point of view, very much so.
					</p>
					
   					<p>
   						All I want to do is write about the view of the trees, dark and light, thick and thin, weak and sturdy, so much variation in appearance and texture. Some bending, some still, some shaking. Variety is in everything. The trees seem anxious and unforgiving but they are present and always will be. Not racing ahead into the future to escape the now. Unlike humans, unlike me. I am being, I have been here a while now experiencing this. And it’s interesting.
   					</p>	

					<p>
						Where is my mind going? It doesn’t seem far from usual, just here and there and thinking about this prose and the next word. Words and things and thoughts that don’t develop because I am focused on writing, and the next line, and what that will include and what inspired it. I am overanalysing already, just enjoy it. I dare you. Enjoy it why not? Just keep going for a while, it’s okay, there may be some change soon. Hunger again. This is repetitive and thus why I ignore it and try to rid of it. It’s a burden I can’t be bothered to satisfy each time it crops up - one hundred times a day or more - I have no time for this to be met, I have things to do and places to go and sleep to sleep. And how is it possible to just eat until satisfied? Again and again.
					</p>
				

					<p>
						The sky has dropped to an all grey mass, hidden behind spindly branches. The mood has dropped with my writing as if projected into the sky. I can still think. Think more. More and more about what is left. I am me. Someone who types rather than writes, someone searching for answers, peace and stability, searching for change yet not harbouring any change, expecting what is not likely in the scheme of current behaviour. 
					</p>	

					<p>
						I certainly feel some form of release hitting these keys over and over again; creating sounds and patterns of digits and pitches and tapping and pressing until something is expressed and who knows what? And who is the one to interpret and perceive this other than me? Who can decipher this into understanding and meaningful words? Paragraphs of ideas and fragments of trails of thought and feeling.
					</p>		

					<p>
						I feel my brow is tense, it has been all day and it feels heavy upon my head and shrunken inward creating a pressure on my forehead like a bag of sand stretching the skin downwards, with time the only other influence. And is that the task? To develop myself - persona and entity - a soul with spirit and meaning and worth. An understanding of oneself and others and the world around. 
					</p>	

					<p>
						The screen is dimmed and I can hardly see my patterns of words emerging. A foul smell has followed me, lingering indefinitely. Foul, though delicate and with no signs of fading. Sensing the foul parts of the Earth in tandem with beautiful experiences; the paradoxical nature of this life. Pure and impure guiding my days through rough and smooth, enjoyment and distress, torture and ecstasy. Why so inconsistent are they? 
					</p>	

					<p>
						How can stability be achieved? I for one cannot provide answers yet. This life is too much of a ride without known destination, departure or arrival times, just a flow of energy and time and feelings that eventually end in something quite different. Something so bizarre and abstract that no-one can explain the experience; no-one will ever be able to blow the dust off the enigmatic end of life, human or otherwise.
