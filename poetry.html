					<h4>
						Nothing Left
					</h4>
					
					<p>
						There's no beauty left,<br />
						It's turned to frost,<br />
						You may see it in a partner,<br />
						Or lover, lost,<br />
						To space and time,<br />
						And seas uncrossed.
					</p>	
					
					<h3>
						AN
					</h3>

					<p>
						See a picture; reminisce,<br />
						Read the words; no longer missed.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If through the eyes, one sees the soul,<br />
						And there you meet a tortured girl,<br />
						Walk on, head up and shoulders back,<br />
						You shan't return, nor shall you crack.	
					</p>
					
					<p>
						What's in you now is good and gold,<br />
						Something She will never know.<br />
						<br />	
					</p>	
					
					
					<h4>
						He
					</h4>
						
					<p>
						He's gone, and so what?<br />
						He's here, okay good,<br />
						And neither one is any good,<br />
						So,<br />
						Why do you care?
					</p>
					
					<p>
						It's fine, they're learning curves,<br />
						Or books, or studies, or journals filled,<br />
						And never you get what you want, nor need,<br />
						For this is a world of greed.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So move on, head up and shoulders back,<br />
						You shall grow on and shall not crack,<br />
						What's in you now is good as gold,<br />
						Something She should have been told.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So,<br />
						Carry on and don't look back,<br />
						You'll develop soul and strength and tact,<br />
						For years to come and years e'en more,<br />
						Until you cannot write any more,<br />
						For what you have is more than most,<br />
						Use it dear or fear the most,<br />
						For why we cannot know for sure,<br />
						But it's been wtitten long before.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						No man can publish this for you,<br />
						It's all in here and only for you,<br />
						It's hard to say of what's to come,<br />
						But take it between forefinger and thumb,<br />
						For this gold nib creates your art,<br />
						So you can always express this heart,<br />
						Kept upon pages,<br />
						Bound between leather.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						And there you'll find the lost little girl,<br />
						Whom had no-one and never will,<br />	
						For we are always lonesome,<br />
						Until we meet that one,<br />
						Or come to an end,<br />
						And either way you'll never send,<br />
						The words to those who need to know,<br />
						'Cause this was always your seed to sow,<br />
						And why I write so deeply so,<br />
						For no apparency to those?<br />
						It's mere darkness, I suppose.
					</p>	
					
					<h5>
						Read Something
					</h5>
					
					<p>
						Read some books,<br />
						And hide from the world,<br />
						Lord, if I could change it,<br />
						I certainly would.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						It might be futile,<br />
						So I'll dream on,<br />
						Take some noxious substances,<br />
						And so,<br />
						The night will drag on.
					</p>
