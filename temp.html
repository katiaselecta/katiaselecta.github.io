Just write and release and unload. Breakfast never enough to satisfy; my body craves attention, love and peace. My skin and warmth are comfortable, and my hair is smooth. I’m growing like a strand of hair, precariously for I may split or fall. Tied up until let down and trimmed fresh each time.
</p>
<p>
I am free, my body is free, to share. Free and light and meaningful; open to experience, not searching for experience. Patience and they will come. They are coming, I’m moving away in four days, the experience on the horizon waiting for me to reach it, nervously anticipating my presence in the plan unfolding. Like crumpled paper into a sketch, an art-piece, to be framed and saved, adored. Appreciated for what it is and what it may be interpreted to be, to mean. A flower blossoming late, during a spring long after its peers. The other blossoms budded and bloomed and fell apart back into the Earth. To repeat. Insects help to spread this love of life and growth. Spirited leaders of the cycle.

Part of my journey, allowing the growth, change and fluctuations that come with seasons. I adjust slowly to the Earth’s changes and the internal changes I experience. But I will grow from the dust like a phoenix, or a sturdy tree with a legacy. Saplings surrounding it as it nourishes itself without thoughts or conscious effort. Habitual it will become to feel free, healthy and full of life. Every day as intended upon this Earth.

For centuries others may have been me, suffering at the hand of oneself, struggling to see beauty. Hiding from the light, under dark damp rock, reflecting peace away in attempt to protect oneself from misery; only harbouring more of that fear - misery. But there is hope, there always has been. Peace comes when one feels settled and comforted by all surroundings, regardless of light, mood, company, luxuries. One must find comfort in the small things, the free things bestowed upon this Earth for enjoyment. Enjoy the fruits of this life, or do not experience life at all. Mere survival does not turn into gratitude and acceptance, it kills life and joy and stuffs them away in a box somewhere. They seem alive, though they are not. One must open the box, sow the seeds, water and nurture them until the next spring and they will astound you and present you once again with life for oneself.

I cannot feel circulation in my toes, they long to be free of this tortured body. Days like these are tough, a waiting game that I play alone. Watching time, not experiencing it or utilising its fleeting presence. Just allowing it to flow downstream, ever further away, ever harder to grasp. Nothing is seeded in the absence of acceptance of time.
</p>

Freed by expression, my thoughts are out of me. They belong not to me, they are not me. I should not starve them of this release any longer. They should be shared. With paper, pens, people, loves. The Earth deserves to know what it has created within me. As do I, deserve to note what is going on; always to be aware. To be aware is to experience, it is natural yet avoidable, with only detriment to the avoider.
